# 🎭 PARADOX LOG – Game Design Document

---

## Core Design Pillars

1. **Choice Has Weight**
2. **Perspective Changes Meaning**
3. **Control Is Not Neutral**
4. **There Is No Perfect Timeline**

---

## Narrative Structure

The story alternates between two versions of the same character:

- **Past Self** – idealistic, reactive, uncertain
- **Future Self** – pragmatic, controlling, burdened

The player controls both, forcing internal conflict.

---

## Act Breakdown

### Act I – Future Self
Shows the consequences of unseen past decisions.

### Act II – Past Self
Introduces choice and interference.

### Act III – Future Self
Deals with damage control and moral compromise.

### Act IV – Past Self
Witnesses the first visible fractures.

### Act V – Future Self
Approaches tyranny or collapse.

### Act VI – Past Self
Final judgment and resolution.

---

## Moral Systems

### Tyrant Index
Tracks authoritarian behavior and forced outcomes.

### Timeline Stability
Tracks how broken the world has become.

### Self-Trust
Tracks alignment between past and future selves.

No system is purely good or bad.

---

## Time Anomalies

Used as:
- Narrative obstacles
- Choice stressors
- World-state indicators

Examples:
- Loops
- Reverse causality
- Aging effects
- Memory desync

---

## Tools as Philosophy

Each major tool represents an idea:
- Chrono Blade → Awareness
- Aion Compass → Control
- Paradox Gauntlet → Power
- Codex of Regression → Regret
- Singularity Core → Acceptance

---

## Endings Philosophy

Endings are not rewards.

They are **conclusions**.

Every ending reflects:
- What you valued
- What you feared
- What you were willing to sacrifice

---

## Player Takeaway

The game asks one question repeatedly:

> “If you could fix everything…  
> who decides what ‘fixed’ means?”

---

## Design Goal

To make the player uncomfortable —  
not because the choices are unclear,  
but because they are understandable.

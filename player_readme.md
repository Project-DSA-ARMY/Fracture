### A Text-Based Time Paradox RPG

## What Is Paradox Log?

**Paradox Log** is a narrative-driven, text-based RPG where you experience a fractured timeline from **two perspectives** — your **Past Self** and your **Future Self**.

Every decision you make echoes across time.

Sometimes you live with the consequences.  
Sometimes you travel back to erase them.

And sometimes… you become the problem you were trying to solve.

- Story-focused text RPG
- Choice-driven gameplay
- Alternating playable characters
- Deep moral consequences
- Multiple endings
- Designed for mobile play sessions

This game is about **identity**, **control**, and **sacrifice**.

## How the Game Works

- The story is divided into **six acts**
- Each act is played as either:
  - **Past Self** (making choices)
  - **Future Self** (handling consequences)
- Your choices permanently alter:
  - The world
  - Characters
  - The ending

You cannot see all outcomes in one playthrough.

---

## Time & Choice

You will encounter:
- Time loops
- Aging and de-aging characters
- Broken causality
- Alternate outcomes
- Conversations with your future or past self

Some choices feel right.  
Some choices feel necessary.  
Some choices will haunt you.

## Endings

There are multiple endings depending on:
- Your moral decisions
- How much control you exert
- Whether you trust yourself

There is no single “correct” ending.

Only the one you create.

## Replayability

- Different dialogue paths
- Hidden story logs
- New choices unlocked in replays

Every playthrough reveals something new.

## Final Note

This is not a game about saving the world.

It’s about deciding **what kind of person is allowed to save it**.

# 📘 PARADOX LOG
### A Text-Based Time Paradox RPG for Mobile

---

## 🕰 Overview

**Paradox Log** is a narrative-driven, text-based RPG built for mobile platforms.  
The game explores time paradoxes, identity, and moral consequence by placing the player in control of **two versions of the same character** — a **Past Self** and a **Future Self** — across a fractured timeline.

The story unfolds across **six acts**, alternating perspectives. Every choice made in the past reshapes the future, and every action taken in the future attempts to correct (or enforce) those outcomes.

This project focuses on:
- Deep branching narrative
- Replayability
- Consequence tracking
- Philosophical storytelling
- Mobile-friendly text systems

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Concept

- **Genre:** Text-Based RPG / Interactive Fiction  
- **Platform:** Mobile (Android / iOS)  
- **Perspective:** Alternating protagonists (Past Self / Future Self)  
- **Input Style:** Choice-driven text decisions  
- **Replay Focus:** High (multiple endings, hidden states)

The player is never just reacting to the story — they are **actively arguing with themselves across time**.

---

## 🧩 Story Structure (Acts & Flow)

The game is divided into **6 Acts**, each representing a major timeline shift.

| Act | Playable Character | Core Theme |
|----|------------------|-----------|
| Act I | Future Self | Consequences of past choices |
| Act II | Past Self | First interference & free will |
| Act III | Future Self | Damage control & escalation |
| Act IV | Past Self | Seeds of collapse |
| Act V | Future Self | Edge of tyranny |
| Act VI | Past Self | Final judgment & endings |

Each act unlocks:
- New systems or mechanics
- Narrative logs
- Tools / weapons tied to time manipulation
- Permanent changes to the timeline

---

## 🔁 Dual-Protagonist System

### Past Self
- Makes foundational moral choices
- Believes the future can still be avoided
- Experiences early time anomalies
- Represents **hope and uncertainty**

### Future Self
- Lives with the consequences
- Uses control and manipulation to preserve stability
- Intervenes directly in the past
- Represents **pragmatism and sacrifice**

The player controls **both**, but never fully agrees with either.

## 📊 Core Game Systems

### 🧠 Timeline Variables

These values are tracked globally and persist across acts:

- **Tyrant Index**  
  Measures how authoritarian the Future Self becomes.

- **Timeline Stability**  
  Determines how broken the world is.

- **Self-Trust Meter**  
  Tracks alignment between Past and Future Selves.

These variables:
- Unlock or block dialogue options
- Alter act outcomes
- Decide the final boss and endings

---

## 🗡 Weapons & Tools (Narrative Mechanics)

Each act introduces a **key weapon or tool**, represented textually but with mechanical impact.

Examples:
- **Chrono Blade** – Reveals future consequences in dialogue  
- **Aion Compass** – Highlights stability-based choices  
- **Paradox Gauntlet** – Absorbs or suppresses anomalies  
- **Codex of Regression** – Allows limited rewrites of past events  
- **Singularity Core** – Final convergence tool

Weapons are not just combat tools — they change **how the player reads and interprets choices**.

---

## 🛡 Armor, Shields & Protection

Armor and shields represent **philosophical stances**, not just defense.

Examples:
- Authority-based armor improves control
- Mercy-based gear improves negotiation
- Stability gear reduces chaos side effects

Shield mechanics:
- Choice negation
- Fatal consequence prevention
- Limited timeline protection

---

## ❤️ Healing & Recovery Systems

Healing is handled through **time-based mechanics**, not health bars.

Examples:
- **Chrono Reversal:** Undo a recent decision  
- **Memory Shards:** Heal through forgiveness  
- **Time Anchors:** Prevent timeline collapse in an act  
- **Cathedral Blessings:** Passive stability recovery  

Some healing methods **increase Tyrant Index**, forcing trade-offs.

---

## 🧪 Time Anomalies (Narrative Events)

Common anomalies include:
- Groundhog-style loops
- Rapid aging / de-aging
- Time slipping NPCs
- Decay and reverse-causality events

These appear as:
- Special encounters
- Unique dialogue trees
- World-state modifiers

---

## 🏁 Endings

The final act determines one of several endings, including:

- Kill the Future Self
- Merge Past and Future
- Sacrifice the Past Self
- Timeline reset (New Game+)
- Hidden reconciliation ending

Endings depend on:
- Tyrant Index
- Timeline Stability
- Self-Trust Meter
- Key irreversible choices

---

## 📱 Mobile Design Considerations

- Designed for **short play sessions**
- Acts broken into readable segments
- Auto-save after major decisions
- Clean, scroll-friendly text UI
- Minimal animations, maximal narrative impact

---

## 🔄 Replayability

- Multiple moral paths
- Perspective-dependent dialogue
- Locked content revealed on replays
- Hidden logs and memories
- New Game+ timeline variations

No two playthroughs should feel identical.

## ✍️ Author Notes

This game is about **identity**, **inevitability**, and **the cost of control**.

The player is never asked:

> “What is the right choice?”

Only:

> “What are you willing to become to protect the future?”
